							<p>Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally-bound structures in the universe. They are also the most powerful gravitational lenses, acting as cosmic telescopes for the faintest and furthest universe. Studying their mass distribution requires great human and computational resources, because of their complex internal structure, but it is very heplful to gather insight into their formation process and nature.</p>
							<p>Simulations play a crucial role in this scenario. They allow for testing and validating different analysis techniques, to ensure their accuracy and robustness before being applied to real observations. Moreover, they help refining mass reconstruction methods, which can achieve percent-level precision. Additionally, they offer a means to explore discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observations, thus probing the Î›-CDM cosmological model. </p>
                                                        <p>In this project, we have used SkyLens to simulate cluster-scale strong lenses, with an observational setup that reproduces the observations of the Hubble Space Telescope. We use a Navarro-Frenk-White profile to modeol the main dark matter halo of the clusters and pseudo-isothermal ellipsoid mass distributions for the population of cluster members. Along with the images and the catalogs of galaxies, we also release the deflection angle maps and convergence maps of the clusters.</p>
                                                        <p>Our aim is to provide a realistic data set that can support studies of strong lensing by galaxy clusters, facilitate the development of machine learning techniques, and contribute to the interpretation of future survey data. </p>
