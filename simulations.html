							<p>Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally-bound structures in the universe. They are also the most powerful gravitational lenses, acting as cosmic telescopes for the faintest and furthest universe. Studying their mass distribution requires a great effort, given their complex internal structure, but it is very heplful to gather insight into their formation process and nature.</p>
							<p>Simulations play a crucial role in this scenario. They allow for testing and validating different analysis techniques, to ensure that their accuracy before being applied to real observations. Given the complexity of galaxy clusters, simulations help refine mass reconstruction methods, which can achieve percent-level precision. Additionally, they offer a means to explore discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observations, such as the unexpected abundance of galaxy-scale lenses within clusters (see e.g. Meneghetti et al. 2020), which challenges the Î›-CDM cosmological model. </p>
                                                       <!-- <p>With the increasing number of observed strong lensing systems expected from the ongoing wide-field survey of Euclid and the upcoming one of LSST, the need for automated and efficient analysis tools is greater than ever. Machine learning methods are becoming essential for handling the vast amount of data these missions will provide. To support their development, realistic simulated datasets are needed to train, validate, and benchmark algorithms designed to detect and model strong lenses. </p> -->
                                                        <p>In this project, we have used SkyLens to simulate images of strong lensing galaxy clusters, incorporating realistic observational conditions from the Hubble Space Telescope. The mass distribution of the individual clusters is modeled using an NFW dark matter halo and a population of cluster members, whose properties are assigned based on empirical relations. Along with the images and the catalogs of galaxies, we also release the deflection angle maps and convergence maps of the clusters.</p>
                                                        <p>Our aim is to provide a highly realistic dataset that can support strong lensing studies by galaxy clusters, facilitate the development of machine learning techniques, and contribute to the interpretation of future survey data. </p>
